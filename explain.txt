Phase 1: Preparation (The Grid)

You cannot "carve" a maze if you don't have a block of stone to start with.

    Action: Create a 2D array (list) where every cell is a Wall (#).

    Rule: Use odd numbers for your width and height (e.g., 11×11). This ensures you always have a wall between your paths.


Phase 2: The Strategy (DFS Logic)

This is the "Search" part of Depth-First Search.

    Start: Pick a starting point (like 0,0).

    Look Ahead: Look for a neighbor that is two steps away.

    Check: Is that neighbor still a wall? Has it been visited?

    Move: If it's valid, break the wall in between and jump to that new cell.


Phase 3: The Backtrack (The "Recursive" Part)

What happens when you are surrounded by paths and have nowhere to go?

    Action: The function "finishes" for that cell and returns to the previous one.

    Result: The computer automatically goes back through your path until it finds a cell that still has a hidden neighbor to explore.


Phase 4: Termination

    Ending: Once the computer backtracks all the way to the start and find no more walls to break, the maze is finished.
